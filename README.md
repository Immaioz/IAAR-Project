# Automated AI-based pick-and-place system using Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V

## Robot model:
Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V (https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/simulating/training-models/511938-sim-3d-robot-24v-simulation)

## Goal: 
Reproducing a scenario of a pick and place system with proximity sensor and object recognition (AI)

Main objects in the scene:
- 1 conveyor belt
- 1 proximity sensor (photoelectric)
- Fischertechnik 3D-Robot 24V
- Siemens PLC
- 2 webcams

## How to run and how to connect cables phyisically


### About
This repository contains the server and client python files, a simulation video and a documentation. The project is created by two university students (Vincenzo Aricò and Enrico Catalfamo) at UNIME (University of Messina). The project is part of the Industrial automation and robotics (IAAR) course, specifically, the first project for Module B.
